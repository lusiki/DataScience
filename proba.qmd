## Software requirements

##  External software

Today we'll be using [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/), which is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to discover CSS selectors. Install the extension directly [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb). Please note that SelectorGadget is only available for Chrome. If you prefer using Firefox, then you can try [ScrapeMate](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scrapemate/).

```{r}
## Install development version of rvest if necessary
if (numeric_version(packageVersion("rvest")) < numeric_version('0.99.0')) {
  remotes::install_github('tidyverse/rvest')
}
## Load and install the packages that we'll be using today
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, rvest, lubridate, janitor, data.table, hrbrthemes)
## My preferred ggplot2 plotting theme (optional)
theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum())

```

##  R packages

\- New: \*\*rvest\*\*, \*\*janitor\*\*

\- Already used: \*\*tidyverse\*\*, \*\*lubridate\*\*, \*\*data.table\*\*, \*\*hrbrthemes\*\*

Recall that \*\*rvest\*\* was automatically installed with the rest of the tidyverse. However, these lecture notes assume that you have \*\*rvest\*\* 1.0.0, which \-\-- at the time of writing \-\-- has to installed as the development version from GitHub. The code chunk below should take care of installing (if necessary) and loading the packages that you need for today's lecture.

\> \*\*Tip:\*\* If you can get an error about missing fonts whilst following along with this lecture, that's probably because you don't have \[Arial Narrow\](https://freefontsdownload.net/free-arial-narrow-font-30388.htm) \-\-- required by the \`hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum()\` \*\*ggplot2\*\* theme that I'm using here \-\-- installed on your system. You can resolve this by downloading the font and adding it to your font book (Google it), or by switching to a different theme (e.g. \`theme_set(theme_minimal())\`).

\## Webscraping basics

The next two lectures are about getting data, or "content", off the web and onto our computers. We're all used to seeing this content in our browers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). So we know that it must exist somewhere. However, it's important to realise that there are actually two ways that web content gets rendered in a browser:

1\. Server-side

2\. Client side

You can read \[here\](https://www.codeconquest.com/website/client-side-vs-server-side/) for more details (including example scripts), but for our purposes the essential features are as follows:

\### 1. Server-side

\- The scripts that "build" the website are not run on our computer, but rather on a host server that sends down all of the HTML code.

 - E.g. Wikipedia tables are already populated with all of the information \-\-- numbers, dates, etc. \-\-- that we see in our browser.

\- In other words, the information that we see in our browser has already been processed by the host server.

\- You can think of this information being embeded directly in the webpage's HTML.

\- \*\*Webscraping challenges:\*\* Finding the correct CSS (or Xpath) "selectors". Iterating through dynamic webpages (e.g. "Next page" and "Show More" tabs).

\- \*\*Key concepts:\*\* CSS, Xpath, HTML

\### 2. Client-side

\- The website contains an empty template of HTML and CSS.

 - E.g. It might contain a "skeleton" table without any values.

\- However, when we actually visit the page URL, our browser sends a \*request\* to the host server.

\- If everything is okay (e.g. our request is valid), then the server sends a \*response\* script, which our browser executes and uses to populate the HTML template with the specific information that we want.

\- \*\*Webscraping challenges:\*\* Finding the "API endpoints" can be tricky, since these are sometimes hidden from view.

\- \*\*Key concepts:\*\* APIs, API endpoints

Over the next two lectures, we'll go over the main differences between the two approaches and cover the implications for any webscraping activity. I want to forewarn you that webscraping typically involves a fair bit of detective work. You will often have to adjust your steps according to the type of data you want, and the steps that worked on one website may not work on another. (Or even work on the same website a few months later). All this is to say that \*webscraping involves as much art as it does science\*.

The good news is that both server-side and client-side websites allow for webscraping.\^\[As we'll see during the next lecture, scraping a website or application that is built on a client-side (i.e. API) framework is often easier; particularly when it comes to downloading information \*en masse\*.\] If you can see it in your browser, you can scrape it.

\### Caveat: Ethical \~\~and legal\~\~ considerations

The previous sentence elides some important ethical considerations. Just because you \*can\* scrape it, doesn't mean you \*should\*. Now, I first have to tell you that this paragraph used to contain a warning about the legal restrictions pertaining to webscraping activity. I've decided to drop those in the wake of the landmark \[\*hiQ Labs vs LinkedIn\*\](https://twitter.com/kjhealy/status/1255636154453549057) court ruling. (Short version: It is currently legal to scrape data from the web using automated tools, as long as the data are publicly available.) However, it's still important to realise that the tools we'll be using over these next two lectures are very powerful. A computer can process commands much, much faster than we can ever type them up manually. It's pretty easy to write up a function or program that can overwhelm a host server or application through the sheer weight of requests.Or, just as likely, the host server has built-in safeguards that will block you in case of a suspected malicious \[attack\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). We'll return to the "be nice" mantra at the end of this lecture, as well as in the next lecture.

\## Webscraping with \*\*rvest\*\* (server-side)

The primary R package that we'll be using today is \*\*rvest\*\* (\[link\](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/)), a simple webscraping library inspired by Python's \*\*Beautiful Soup\*\* (\[link\](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)), but with extra tidyverse functionality. \*\*rvest\*\* is designed to work with webpages that are built server-side and thus requires knowledge of the relevant CSS selectors... Which means that now is probably a good time for us to cover what these are.

\### Student presentation: CSS and SelectorGadget

Time for a student presentation on \[CSS\](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works) (i.e Cascading Style Sheets) and \[SelectorGadget\](http://selectorgadget.com/). Click on the links if you are reading this after the fact. In short, CSS is a language for specifying the appearance of HTML documents (including web pages). It does this by providing web browsers a set of display rules, which are formed by:

1\. \_Properties.\_ CSS properties are the "how" of the display rules. These are things like which font family, styles and colours to use, page width, etc.

2\. \_Selectors.\_ CSS selectors are the "what" of the display rules. They identify which rules should be applied to which elements. E.g. Text elements that are selected as ".h1" (i.e. top line headers) are usually larger and displayed more prominently than text elements selected as ".h2" (i.e. sub-headers).

The key point is that if you can identify the CSS selector(s) of the content you want, then you can isolate it from the rest of the webpage content that you don't want. This where SelectorGadget comes in. We'll work through an extended example (with a twist!) below, but I highly recommend looking over this \[quick vignette\](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html) before proceding.

\## Application 1: Wikipedia

Okay, let's get to an application. Say that we want to scrape the Wikipedia page on the \[\*\*Men's 100 metres world record progression\*\*\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression).

First, open up this page in your browser. Take a look at its structure: What type of objects does it contain? How many tables does it have? Do these tables all share the same columns? What row- and columns-spans? Etc.

Once you've familiarised yourself with the structure, read the whole page into R using the \`rvest::read_html()\` function.

```{r}

# library(rvest) ## Already loaded

m100 = read_html("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression") 
m100
```

As you can see, this is an \[XML\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) document\^\[XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is one of the primary languages used for encoding and formatting web pages.\] that contains \*everything\* needed to render the Wikipedia page. It's kind of like viewing someone's entire LaTeX document (preamble, syntax, etc.) when all we want are the data from some tables in their paper.

\### Table 1: Pre-IAAF (1881--1912)

Let's start by scraping the first table on the page, which documents the \[unofficial progression before the IAAF\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression#Unofficial_progression_before_the_IAAF). The first thing we need to do is identify the table's unique CSS selector. Here's a GIF of me using \[SelectorGadget\](http://selectorgadget.com/) to do that.

```{r}
if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::include_graphics('08-web-css/pics/sg100m.gif')
} else {
  message("Sorry, this GIF is only available in the the HTML version of the notes.")
}
```

\</br\>

As you can see, working through this iterative process yields \*"div+ .wikitable :nth-child(1)"\*. We can now use this unique CSS selector to isolate the pre-IAAF table content from the rest of the HTML document. The core \*\*rvest\*\* function that we'll use to extract the table content is \`html_element()\`, before piping it on to \`html_table()\` to parse the HTML table into an R data frame.

```{r}
pre_iaaf =
  m100 %>%
  html_element("div+ .wikitable :nth-child(1)") %>% ## select table element
  html_table()                                      ## convert to data frame

pre_iaaf
```

Great, it worked!

I'll tidy things up a bit so that the data frame is easier to work with in R. First, I'll use the \`janitor::clean_names()\` convenience function to remove spaces and capital letters from the column names. (Q: How else could we have done this?) Second, I'll use the \`lubridate::mdy()\` function to convert the date string to a format that R actually understands.

```{r}
# library(janitor) ## Already loaded
# library(lubridate) ## Already loaded
 
pre_iaaf =
  pre_iaaf %>%
  clean_names() %>%         ## fix the column names
  mutate(date = mdy(date))  ## convert string to date format

pre_iaaf
```

Now that we have our cleaned pre-IAAF data frame, we could easily plot it. I'm going to hold off doing that until we've scraped the rest of the WR data. But first, an aside on browser inspection tools.

\#### Aside: Get CSS selectors via browser inspection tools

SelectorGadget is a great tool. But it isn't available on all browsers and can involve more work than I'd like sometimes, with all that iterative clicking.\^\[Historically, at least, it also had a tendency to provide CSS selectors that weren't exactly what we were looking for. To be fair, this may have reflected some issues coming from the R + \*\*rvest\*\* as much as anything else. These minor incompatibilities have been largely eliminated with \*\*rvest\*\* 1.0.0... \[prompting a re-write\](https://twitter.com/grant_mcdermott/status/1354518507208105984) of these notes!\] I therefore wanted to mention an alternative (and very precise) approach to obtaining CSS selectors: Use the "\[inspect web element\](https://www.lifewire.com/get-inspect-element-tool-for-browser-756549)" feature of your browser.

Here's a quick example using Google Chrome. First, I open up the inspect console (\*\*Ctrl+Shift+I\*\*, or right-click and choose "Inspect"). I then proceed to scroll over the source elements, until Chrome highlights the table of interest on the actual page. Once the table (or other element of interest) is highlighted, I can grab its CSS by right-clicking and selecting \*\*Copy -\> Copy selector\*\*.

```{r}
if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::include_graphics('08-web-css/pics/inspect100m.gif')
} else {
  message("Sorry, this GIF is only available in the the HTML version of the notes.")
}
```

\</br\>

In general, I prefer to obtain CSS selectors using this "inspect" method with my browser. But each to their own.

\### Challenge

Your turn: Download the next two tables from the same WR100m page. Combine these two new tables with the one above into a single data frame and then plot the record progression. Answer below. (No peeking until you have tried first.)

\#### Table 2: Pre-automatic timing (1912--1976)

Let's start with the second table.

```{r}
iaaf_76 =
  m100 %>%
  html_element("#mw-content-text > div > table:nth-child(14)") %>%
  html_table()
```

As we did with the previous table, let's fix the column names and coerce the date string to a format that R understands.

```{r}
iaaf_76 =
  iaaf_76 %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) 

iaaf_76
```

\#### Table 3: Modern Era (1977 onwards)

For the final table, I'll just run the code all at once. By now you should recognise all of the commands.

```{r}
iaaf =
  m100 %>%
  html_element("#mw-content-text > div > table:nth-child(19)") %>%
  html_table() %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date))

iaaf
```

\### Combined eras plot

Let's combine our three separate tables into a single data frame. I'll use base R's \`rbind()\` to bind by row and include only the variables that are common to all of the three data frames. For good measure, I'll also add an extra column describing which era each record was recorded under.

```{r}
wr100 = 
  rbind(
    pre_iaaf %>% select(time, athlete, nationality, date) %>% mutate(era = "Pre-IAAF"),
    iaaf_76 %>% select(time, athlete, nationality, date) %>% mutate(era = "Pre-automatic"),
    iaaf %>% select(time, athlete, nationality, date) %>% mutate(era = "Modern")
    )

wr100
```

All that hard works deserves a nice plot, don't you think?

```{r}
wr100 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=time, col=fct_reorder2(era, date, time))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Men's 100m world record progression",
    x = "Date", y = "Time",
    caption = "Source: Wikipedia"
    ) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) ## Switch off legend title
```

\## Application 2: Craiglist

There are several features of the previous Wikipedia example that make it a good introductory application. Most notably, the HTML table format provides a regular structure that is easily coercible into a data frame (via \`html_table()\`). Oftentimes, however, the information that we want to scrape off the web doesn't have this nice regular structure. For this next example, then, I'm going to walk you through a slightly more messy application: Scraping items from \[Craiglist\](https://craigslist.org).

The specific items that I'm going to scrape here are \[audio speakers for sale in my local city of Eugene\](https://eugene.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=speakers&sort=rel&srchType=T). But you can adjust the relevant URL search parameters to your own preferences \-\-- cars in Chicago, concert tickets in Cleveland, etc. \-\-- and the same principles should carry through.

\### Extract the text

We start as we always do by reading in the HTML.
